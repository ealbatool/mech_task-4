# File Information
3D Model File: joint design printing.stl

Material: ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)



# Why ABS?
ABS was selected for this robotic joint due to its:
✔ High Strength & Durability : Suitable for mechanical stress and repeated movement.
✔ Heat Resistance : Better than PLA, making it ideal for parts near motors or electronics.
✔ Impact Resistance : Less prone to cracking under sudden forces.
